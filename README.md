# Overview

This repository contains a few of my experiemental projects utilizing AI.

## Canvas to Google Calendar

Canvas has a built in feature to export all assignments to a calendar, but it exports them as events, and only exports the time that the assignment is due. I wanted a program that would allow me to export them as Google Tasks, and put them in my calendar one or two days before they are due, so that I am encourged to get the assignments done early, and it works very well, though it is still unpolished.

## D&D Achievement and Item Generator Agent

I've been putting together a unique dungeons and dragons adventure for me and a few of my friends, and the way it's set up requires a lot of on-the-spot rewards. I designed an agent that would take some of the load off me, though the items it generates are still currently very unbalanced.
